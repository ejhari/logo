LOGO is a very simple program to create geometrical
shapes on a Tkinter ’canvas’. It was implemented 
using Python. 

THe defined abilities were to move a given distance,
turn a given angle clockwise or anti-clockwise, 
'show' or 'hide' a moving figure of arbitrary shape,
and decide between ’pen down’ and ’pen up’ modes. 

Finally the Koch Snowflake, Quadratic Type1 and 
Quadratic Type2 fractals were drawn as a final touch.
To get a clear picture of the fractals, refer
